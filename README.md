# Code Challenge:

## Introduction:

Welcome to the React Developer Technical Assessment! This test is designed to evaluate your proficiency in building React applications using a modern stack, including Redux Toolkit, Vite, React Router and TurboRepo. We have prepared a set of tasks and questions that cover a spectrum of skills, ranging from fundamental concepts to more advanced topics.

### Tasks:

Complete the provided tasks to demonstrate your ability to work with React, Redux Toolkit, Vite, and TurboRepo. Adjust the complexity based on your experience level.

### Questions:

Answer the questions to showcase your understanding of the underlying concepts and best practices associated with the technologies in use.

### Time Limit:

This assessment is designed to take approximately 1 hour to complete. Please manage your time effectively.

### Setup the reporsitory:

Make sure you have pnpm installed<br>
Install dependencies with `pnpm`<br>
Run the project with `turbo run dev` or `pnpm run dev`

### prerequisite:

Start the test by Forking this repository, and complete the following tasks:<br>

## Task 1:

Assignment: Use the `api` found in `App.tsx` to make a request and fetch a list of all Pokémon.<br>
Question 1: How did you manage to fetch the list and what tool did you use?<br>

    When the component loaded, I retrieved the Pokémon list using React's useEffect hook. A GET request was sent to the Pokémon API using the fetch API, and the response was converted to JSON. I used useState to store the list in the component's state and then presented the Pokémon names as a straightforward list.

Question 2: What steps would you take to future improve this?<br>

    To make things more organized, move the API logic to a separate file.
    To maintain the Pokémon list on a global scale, use Redux or another equivalent state management framework.
    Display a loading spinner or animation when the data is being fetched.

commit the code as `task-1`<br>

## Task 2:

Assignment: Parse the list to the `<List />` component and ajust the component to show a list of all pokémon names
Feel free to create more components in the `/ui` package or in the app if needed

commit the code as `task-2`<br>

## Task 3:

Assignment: Style the `<List />` component to display as a grid.

commit the code as `task-3`<br>

## Task 4:

Assignment: Introduce `redux-toolkit` and store the list of pokémon in the redux store.<br>
Question 4: What makes the `createSlice` in redux-toolkit difference then A Reducer in redux?<br>
Question 5: Describe the benefits of immutable code.<br>

commit the code as `task-4`<br>

## Task 5:

Assignment: Create button for each pokémon where an Action will be dispatched to remove the pokémon from the store
Question 6: How can you verify the action has been dispatched?

## Task 6:

Question 7: explain the use of `useEffect` hook in React
Question 8: What is A High Order Component?
Question 9: What use cases would a HOC be usefull?
Question 10: What does it indicate when a component is prefixed with `use` and `with`
Question 11: What is a Generic type in typescript?
Question 12: Whats the difference between a controlled and uncontrolled input in React?
